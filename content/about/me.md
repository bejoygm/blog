Hi there! I have worked most of my adult life as a software engineer. 

I enjoy outdoors a lot and most of my hobbies revolves around that, except maybe reading and writing. But you can do that under the sun, except maybe when it rains? There's waterproof kindle and I have seen divers writing underwater, so go out there and write while it rains and write when it doesn't.
