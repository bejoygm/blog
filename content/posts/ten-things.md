In the spirit of Nick Crocker's [Thirty Things Iâ€™ve Learned](https://medium.com/things-ive-written/thirty-things-ive-learned-482765ee3503).

**1. Ask what is this? Ask again.** Sometimes I vaguely understand something and  draw lot of conclusions on top of that. Ask continuously "what is this?"

**2. Keep writing. Almost everyday** I look back at some of my writings of 5 years ago and feel how stupid I was. I will look at this writing again and feel the same way.

**3. Remove the illusion that you are smart and others are stupid** A lot of people are smarter than I am. Remove the illusion to learn from them.

**4. Share your progress with friends/family** Discussing my progress with my closed ones allows me to take a step back and see if I'm moving in right direction.

**5. Multiply the price by 5. See if you still buy it** We end up buying stuff we don't need. We eat fast food because it is cheap.

**6. Repeat to the point of boredom before automating** I tend to automate a lot of stuff that I don't end up using regularly.

**7. Exercise regularly** My favourite show can wait. When it's time to run, run.

**8. Experience the physical limit of your life in your prime** I started running and after some time I did my first 5k. Day by day I'm improving on the time it takes to complete 5k. Some days the diff is just a few seconds. Chances are I will reach a state which cannot be improved further. That would be a great day.

**9. Remove assumptions that simple things are boring** I used to look at people playing table tennis for years and never approached it because it looked very simple and I thought I would be bored soon. Now it's one of my favorite activities.

**10. Be present** To give complete attention to what's in front of you. Be interested, not interesting.
